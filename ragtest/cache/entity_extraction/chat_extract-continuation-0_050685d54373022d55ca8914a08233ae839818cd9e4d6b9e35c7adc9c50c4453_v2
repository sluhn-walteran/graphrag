Umm, And so we did and it was at 96, but I wanted to wait a little bit just to see if maybe it would go back up again. So we waited another 15 minutes and now we're at 95.9. Umm. And so basically I'm just trying to to see at what point should I be taking him to the hospital? I mean, he's very sleepy because, you know, it's the time, but he is right now awake. So his eyes are open, he's smiling, he makes, he's making sense. But it, you know, it's just that it just keeps dropping. No. Umm he's wearing a long sleeve shirt and sweatpants but I have him under 2 blankets like too fizzy blankets and my husband's also with him so he's he has the ability to be getting warmer. No, not SH, no, that was me. Sorry. We've all been dealing with this whole virus and he's just the one that's hitting the hardest with the fever. No, his feet didn't look bluish. His hands didn't look no, his FA, his feet look normal. You know he not that he has like a whole ton of color in his face, but he's his ears are cold. He's just, you know, he's doesn't look blue. Yeah, he wasn't. Right. I mean, it's I, he's, it's going back and forth. I, it's kind of actually surprising that he perked up a little bit now because he's been, so, you know, you know, 'cause he's wants to go to sleep. He's been hard to, you know, keep up to try to take his temperature or he's falling asleep while I'm trying to take his temperature. But he's, he's awake now. He makes sense when like he knows where he is, he can answer questions. Umm. Yes. OK, OK NN no. So I just wanna wor. I just wanna I if it goes below 95. OK. OK, OK. Yes. OK, great. Thank you.
